# Setup
- Download and install `node` and `npm` [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- Download and install `yarn` from [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)
- Run `yarn` to install the necessary packages
- run `yarn start` to run the application locally

# Hosting

- Run `yarn build` and `yarn deploy` to deploy the application changes on `gh-pages`
- Application is hosted [here](https://myrdstom.github.io/) 

# Notes
- Hosted the frontend on `gh-pages` as this is quick for rapid demoing
- Better error handling on a more production level application is needed
- Tests were ignored in the interest of time, but I do have multiple repos showing my testing experience
- A loader can be added to improve user experience
